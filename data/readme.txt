(A)
- Content of MC10:
	Results on the Murray and Chu instances with 10 customers:
	We report:
	- THe name of the instance
	- THe number of UAV	
	- The best LB	
	- The best UB	
	- THe computing time in seconds	
	- The percentage gap between the best UB and LB
	- A column with a 1 if the obtain solution is optimal
- Content of MC20:
	Results on the Murray and Chu instances with 20 customers:
	We report:
	- THe name of the instance
	- THe number of UAV	
	- The best LB	
	- The best UB	
	- THe computing time in seconds	
	- The percentage gap between the best UB and LB
	- A column with a 1 if the obtain solution is optimal
- Content of TSPLIB_Saleu:
	Results on the instances generated by Saleu et al. from the TSPLIB for the 
	PDSTSP:
	We report:
	- The percentage of drone eligibility among the customers	
	- The drone speed	
	- The number of drones available
	- The depot location
	- The best known solution
	- The results of the Fast	heuristic
	- The results of the RRLS	heuristic
	- If the new best known solution is obtained

(B)
TSPLIB based instances for the PDSTSP as for Saleu et al.
For each TSPLIB instance a set of .csv files with different drone eligibility 
is reported, each one with the set of customers, with the coordinates and the 
drone eligibility expressed with a 1 (drone eligible) or a 0 (non drone eligible).

(C)
Reports the best known solution for the TSPLIB based instances for the PDSTSP 
as for Saleu et al.
